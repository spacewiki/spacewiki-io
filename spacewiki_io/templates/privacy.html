This document describes what information we collect and what itâ€™s used for. It
applies to all interactions with spacewiki.io. Your use of spacewiki.io
services will constitute your agreement to our Privacy Policy.  Please also
review our <a href="{{url_for('routes.tos')}}">Terms of Service</a>.

<h2>Summary</h2>
You have a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or
data transiting or stored on this information system. We collect very little
personal information, and none of the information we do collect is ever shared.

<h2>Information we collect and retain</h2>

<h3>Registration information</h3>
When you sign in to SpaceWiki or add SpaceWiki to your team, we retain data
provided to us by the Slack API. This is limited to display names, user names,
Slack API identifiers for users and teams, and email addresses.

<h3>Page Editing</h3>
The history of all edits to all pages on your team are retained until your
team's wiki is deleted. In addition to associating edits to a Slack API
identifier, the date and time of each edit is collected.

<h3>Session Identifiers</h3>
While currently logged in, we keep a temporary session identifier on your
computer that your software uses to prove your authentication state. This is
erased immediately after you log out or the session expires. We do not use any
third party cookies or tracking of any kind, except those furnished by
Stripe.js during the payment processing of a team's initial setup.

<h2>Information we choose to not retain</h2>

<h3>IP addresses</h3>
No IP addresses of any user for any service are retained.

<h3>Browser fingerprint</h3>
Your web browser communicates uniquely identifying information to all web
servers it visits by allowing the site to know details about your operating
system, browser information, plugins installed, fonts installed, screen
resolution, and much more. We do not retain any of this information.

<h2>How we store and share collected information</h2>
<h3>Encryption</h3>
All of your data is stored in an unencrypted format on disk, however our servers
only communicate across the public internet using SSL encryption.  SpaceWiki
will store all data in an encrypted format prior to exiting our public Alpha
access period.

<h3>We do not share user information</h3>
We retain only the bare minimum of information about each user that is required
to make the service work. We do not sell or share any of it.

<h3>Account deletion</h3>
You may choose to delete your SpaceWiki.io team at any time. Doing so will
destroy all the data we retain that is associated with your team. Team 
deletion is currently performed manually, and on written request to
support@spacewiki.io.

<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
We reserve the right to change this policy. If we make major changes, we will
notify our users in a clear and prominent manner. Minor changes may only be
highlighted in the footer of our website.
